# Time-discontinuous-plasticity

This repository contains the code used to simulate the time-discontinuous plasticity model introduced in the article "A time-discontinuous elasto-plasticity formalism to simulate instantaneous plastic flow bursts". The model, implemented in FEniCSX, introduces a plastic threshold parameter, Œîùëùmin, which captures the spatial and temporal localization of plastic flow in elastoplastic materials.

# Contents

"time_discontinuous_plasticity_fenicsx.py": Contains the source code for the time-discontinuous plasticity model in FEniCSX

"Flat_specimen_refined_01.msh": Contains the geometry used in the reference simulation

"averaged_data": Folder where simulation statistics of stress and plastic strain are save. They are obtained by volume integration over the gauge length.

# Requirements
Before running the simulations, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

Installation instructions can be found at the FEniCSX Documentation

NumPy: 1.24.3

SciPy: 1.11.4
